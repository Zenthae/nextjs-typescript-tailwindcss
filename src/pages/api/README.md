# API ROUTES

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your API Routes.
Any file inside the folder `pages/api` is mapped to `/api/*` and will be treated as an API endpoint instead of a `page`.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).

# PAGES

This directory contains your Application Views and Routes.
The framework reads all the `*.js`, `*.jsx`, `*.ts`, `*.tsx` files inside this directory and creates the router of your application.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages).
